## The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp: Advanced Projects & Daily Code

### 🚀 Overview: Journey to Python Mastery

This repository serves as the complete, **daily-updated** artifact log for my immersive Python Bootcamp journey. It contains a curated collection of projects and exercises, moving beyond foundational concepts to explore the most powerful and advanced topics in modern Python development.

From object-oriented design and advanced modules to real-world applications like web scraping, data analysis, and API interactions, this codebase demonstrates a commitment to mastering Python as a professional-grade tool. Each folder represents a core module of the bootcamp, meticulously organized for easy reference.

### 🌟 Project Highlights & Advanced Topics Covered

The core focus of this repository is on complex projects designed to solidify understanding of high-level Python concepts. Key areas of focus include:

| **Module** | **Core Concepts & Projects** | **Mastery Showcase** | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **01. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Base Classes, Dunder methods (`__str__`, `__init__`). | Building complex simulations and structures using pure OOP principles. | 
| **02. Advanced Language Features** | Decorators (function wrappers, utility functions), Generators & Iterators (memory efficiency), Context Managers (`with` statement). | Implementing custom, robust utility wrappers for code enhancement. | 
| **03. Data Handling & Automation** | Working with CSV, JSON, and complex Excel/PDF files. Using the `os` and `pathlib` modules for file system navigation. | Building data merger and file organizer scripts. | 
| **04. Web Development & APIs** | Flask/Django foundational projects, REST API integration (GET/POST requests), Handling API authentication (OAuth). | Creating microservices and accessing live external data. | 
| **05. Web Scraping & Automation** | Using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `Scrapy` to extract structured data from websites. Handling dynamic content. | Developing a custom data collection pipeline for a target website. | 
| **06. Data Science Essentials** | Introduction to `NumPy` for numerical operations and `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis. | Implementing basic data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts. | 
| **07. Concurrency & Parallelism** | Multithreading and Multiprocessing for performance optimization. Handling Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) concerns. | Developing scripts that execute tasks in parallel for speed improvements. | 
| **08. Testing & Debugging** | Using `unittest` and `pytest` for unit testing. Implementing logging for robust error handling. | Writing comprehensive test suites to ensure code reliability. | 

### 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized numerically to reflect the progression of the bootcamp curriculum. Inside each numbered folder, you will find the final project code, supplementary files (like `.csv` or `.json`), and often a brief description of the challenge.
